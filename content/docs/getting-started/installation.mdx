import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The Axiom CLI is a unified tool used by both backend and frontend developers to manage behavioral contracts, build artifacts, and generate client-side code.

### Install the CLI

Choose your preferred installation method. Both methods support macOS and Linux.

<Tabs items={['curl', 'Homebrew']}>
  <Tab value="curl">
    Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://axiomcore.dev/install | sh
    ```
    <Callout type="info">
      The installer automatically sets binaries to `/usr/local/bin`. Because this is a system path, you will likely be prompted for your **sudo password** during the process.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Homebrew">
    If you use Homebrew, you can install via our official tap:
    ```bash
    brew install AxiomCore/tap/axiom
    ```
    <Callout type="info">
      Installing via Homebrew does **not** require sudo permissions as it installs within the Homebrew prefix.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Verification

Once installed, verify that the CLI is correctly configured in your environment:

```bash
axiom --version
```

### What gets installed?

The installation process provides two essential binaries:

1.  **`axiom`**: The primary interface. Used for `init`, `build`, `pull`, and interacting with the Axiom Hub.
2.  **`acore`**: The specialized language engine. It handles the evaluation of your `.acore` (PKL) configuration files.

### Upgrading

Axiom Core is frequently updated with new features and runtime optimizations. To upgrade to the latest version:

<Tabs items={['curl', 'Homebrew']}>
  <Tab value="curl">
    Simply run the installation command again to overwrite the existing binaries with the latest version:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://axiomcore.dev/install | sh
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Homebrew">
    Use the standard Homebrew upgrade command:
    ```bash
    brew upgrade AxiomCore/tap/axiom
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
