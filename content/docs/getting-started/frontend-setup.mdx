Axiom Core eliminates the need for manual data classes, serialization logic, and network boilerplate in your Flutter app.

### 1. Pull the Contract

The `pull` command fetches the contract and generates a **Thin SDK Layer**.

<Tabs items={['Cloud Pull (Recommended)', 'Local Path Pull']}>
  <Tab value="Cloud Pull (Recommended)">
    If your project is linked and you are logged in, simply run:
    ```bash
    axiom pull
    ```
    **The Trust Model:** Axiom pulls the `.axiom` contract and a `trust-axiom.json` file. This file contains the cryptographic signature and public key used by the Rust runtime to ensure the API has not been tampered with.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Local Path Pull">
    Useful for quick testing against a local backend:
    ```bash
    axiom pull --path ../backend-repo/.axiom
    ```
    <Callout type="warn">
      If the source `.axiom` file was built locally (unsigned), the Flutter logs will show a warning: `Running with an unsigned contract`. Verification is bypassed in this mode.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Implementation in Flutter

Axiom generates code in `lib/axiom_generated/`. It includes the SDK and the typed models.

```dart
import 'package:my_app/axiom_generated/axiom_sdk.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  final dbDir = await getApplicationSupportDirectory();
  final sdk = await AxiomSdk.create(
    baseUrl: "BASE_URL",
    dbPath: dbDir.path,
  );

  runApp(MyApp(sdk: sdk));
}
```

### 3. Benefits of the Axiom SDK

Unlike traditional code generators that produce "Fat" boilerplate (thousands of lines of Dart), Axiom produces a **Thin Layer**:

*   **Low Maintenance:** You don't maintain the generated code; it is a direct reflection of the backend contract.
*   **Performance:** All heavy lifting (Retry logic, Caching, JSON Validation) happens in the pre-compiled Rust runtime.
*   **Deterministic:** The behavior is enforced by the `.axiom` file. If the contract says "Retry 3 times," the runtime will do exactly that, regardless of platform.

<Callout type="info">
**Pro Tip:** Run `axiom watch` in your frontend project. It will automatically re-pull the contract and update your Dart models whenever the backend team publishes a new build to the Hub.
