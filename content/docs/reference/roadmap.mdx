### Q3 2025: Platform Expansion
*   **Android & Windows:** Full support for the Rust Runtime on Android (NDK) and Windows.
*   **React Client:** A TypeScript/React SDK that uses a WebAssembly (WASM) version of the Rust runtime.
*   **Kotlin & Swift:** Native SDKs for non-Flutter mobile developers.

### Q4 2025: Advanced Features
*   **Streaming Support:** Deterministic handling of Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSockets.
*   **OAuth Module:** First-class configuration for authentication flows (Google, Apple, Auth0) inside the `.acore` file.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Official GitHub Actions and GitLab Runners to automate building and signing on every commit.

### 2026 and Beyond
*   **Node.js & Go Extractors:** Bring the "Ghost Introspection" magic to other backend ecosystems.
*   **Edge Runtime:** Run the Axiom Runtime on Edge workers (Cloudflare/Vercel) to enforce contracts before they even reach the client.
