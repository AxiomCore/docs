description: Detailed documentation for every Axiom CLI command.

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The Axiom CLI is a unified binary used to manage the entire contract lifecycle—from backend introspection to frontend code generation. You can access the built-in help at any time by running `axiom --help`.

---

### Project Lifecycle

#### `axiom login`
Authenticates your CLI with **Axiom Cloud** using a secure browser-based OAuth flow. Authentication is required to link projects, release signed contracts, and pull from the cloud.

#### `axiom project`
Manages the association between your local development environment and your cloud namespace.

*   **`list`**: Displays all projects in your organization.
*   **`create`**: Launches an interactive prompt to create a new project in Axiom Cloud.
*   **`link`**: Interactively links the current directory to a specific Cloud Project ID. This link is stored locally and is required for releasing signed contracts.

#### `axiom init`
Scans the current directory for supported frameworks (currently FastAPI) and initializes the Axiom environment.
*   **Action**: Generates a default `axiom.acore` file pre-populated with your detected app entry point and project metadata.

---

### Build & Release

#### `axiom build`
The core engine command. It compiles your Python backend structure and your `Acore` configuration into a binary `.axiom` artifact.

*   **Flags**:
    *   `--variant <name>`: Builds a specific variant (e.g., `mobile`, `web`) defined in your config.
    *   `--local`: Forces a local build only, bypassing cloud checks.
    *   `--release`: **(Shortcut)** Builds the contract and immediately triggers a release/signing process in Axiom Cloud.

#### `axiom release`
Uploads your locally built `.axiom` file to Axiom Cloud to be cryptographically signed and versioned.
*   **Action**: Once released, the contract is locked, signed, and made available for frontend developers to fetch.

#### `axiom inspect [path]`
Launches an interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) to explore the compiled contract.
*   **Arguments**: `path` (Defaults to `.axiom` in the current directory).
*   **Action**: Browse all discovered Routes and Models. Use this to verify your Caching, Retry, and Validation policies before deployment.

### Consumption (Frontend)

#### `axiom pull`
The primary command for frontend developers. It fetches the latest contract and prepares the development environment.

*   **Flags**:
    *   `--path <path>`: Pulls from a local `.axiom` file (useful for unsigned/offline development).
    *   `--version <semver>`: Pulls a specific signed version from Axiom Cloud.
*   **Action**: 
    1. Downloads the `.axiom` file and `trust-axiom.json` to the project root.
    2. Syncs `pubspec.yaml` with the `axiom_flutter` runtime dependency.
    3. Triggers the **Thin SDK** generation in `lib/axiom_generated/`.

#### `axiom watch`
Automates the Axiom workflow by watching for file changes.

*   **Flags**:
    *   `--build`: **(Backend mode)** Automatically rebuilds the `.axiom` file whenever Python or Acore files change.
    *   **(Default)**: **(Frontend mode)** Watches for new contract releases on Axiom Cloud and automatically pulls/regenerates the SDK.

---

### Utilities

#### `axiom cache`
Interacts with the local **Sled** database used by the runtime for persistence.

*   **Subcommands**:
    *   `ls`: Lists all currently cached keys, methods, and paths.
    *   `clear`: Safely wipes the local cache database.
    *   `get --key <key>`: Inspects the raw value and metadata stored under a specific cache key.

#### `axiom --version`
Displays the current version of the Axiom CLI and the underlying `acore` engine.
