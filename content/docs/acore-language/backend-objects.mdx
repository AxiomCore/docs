title: Introspecting Backend Objects
description: Accessing Models and Routes as first-class citizens.
---

Acore allows you to treat your backend code as data. You use the `Models` and `Routes` objects to apply configurations.

### Aliasing for Convenience

To keep your configuration clean, it is a best practice to alias your models and routes using the `local` keyword:

```pkl
amends "axiom-python:./main.py:app"

local User = Models.User
local GetUser = Routes.get_user_by_id
```

### Mapping Behavior

To apply a policy to a route or model, you use the object as a key in the `endpoints` or `models` mapping:

```pkl
endpoints {
  [GetUser] {
    // Behavior goes here
    validate = true
  }
}

models {
  [User._model] {
    fields {
      [User.email] {
        // Validation goes here
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note the use of square brackets `[...]`. This is PKL syntax for using an object reference as a key in a mapping.
