title: The 'amends' Keyword
description: Linking your backend source to the contract.
---

The `amends` keyword is the "magic bridge" that connects Axiom to your Python code.

### URI Structure

The URI follows a specific format that tells the Axiom CLI which extractor to use and where to find your app:

```pkl
amends "axiom-python:<path_to_file>:<fastapi_variable_name>"
```

*   **`axiom-python`**: Specifies the Python/FastAPI extractor.
*   **`./main.py`**: The relative path to your entry point.
*   **`app`**: The name of the `FastAPI()` instance in your code.

### What happens during `amends`?

When you use this keyword, the Axiom CLI triggers the **Ghost Parser**. It injects two global objects into your PKL scope:
1.  **`Models`**: A mapping of all discovered Pydantic/SQLAlchemy models.
2.  **`Routes`**: A mapping of all discovered FastAPI endpoints.

<Callout type="info">
Because ACORE is typed, you cannot reference a route that doesn't exist in your Python code. If you rename a function in FastAPI, your `.acore` build will fail until you update the reference.
