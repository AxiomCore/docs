description: Understanding the PKL foundations of Acore.
---

Acore is a configuration language built on top of [Apple's PKL](https://github.com/apple/pkl). Unlike static formats like JSON or YAML, Acore is **programmable, typed, and validated**.

### Key Characteristics

*   **Declarative:** You describe *what* you want (e.g., "Retry 3 times"), not *how* to implement it.
*   **Statically Typed:** Your editor (via the upcoming VS Code extension) knows exactly which fields are available from your backend.
*   **Object-Oriented:** Leverage PKL's inheritance to share caching or retry logic across multiple endpoints without duplication.

### File Structure

An `axiom.acore` file typically follows a specific order to maintain clarity and ensure proper object resolution:

1.  **The Bridge:** Importing your backend structure via the `amends` keyword.
2.  **Metadata:** Defining project-specific information like IDs and versioning.
3.  **Variants:** Defining different API surfaces for different clients (e.g., Mobile vs. Web).
4.  **Global Policies:** Setting default behaviors for all routes.
5.  **Overrides:** Specific behavioral rules for individual models or routes.

### Example Anatomy

```pkl
// 1. The Bridge: Connects to your FastAPI app
amends "axiom-python:./main.py:app"

// 2. Metadata: Project identifiers
project {
  id = "billing-service"
  version = "1.2.0"
}

// 3. Logic & Behavior
variants { 
  ["mobile"] { include = new { "*" } }
}

endpoints { 
  [Routes.get_invoice] {
    cache { strategy = "cache_first"; ttlSeconds = 3600 }
  }
}
