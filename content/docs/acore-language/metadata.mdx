description: Defining project identity and versioning in Acore.
---

The `project` block in your `axiom.acore` file defines the identity of your service. This metadata is used by the Axiom Hub for signing, versioning, and client-side verification.

### The Project Block

Every Acore configuration must include a project metadata block.

```pkl
project {
  id = "payment-gateway"
  version = "1.4.2"
}
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`id`** | `String` | **Required** | A unique identifier for your project. This must match the Project ID in the Axiom Hub to enable signed contracts. |
| **`version`** | `String` | **Required** | The semantic version of the contract. The client runtime uses this to ensure it is running the correct iteration of the API behavior. |

### Relationship with the Hub

When you run `axiom project link`, the CLI ensures that the `id` in your metadata matches the linked project in the cloud. During the `axiom release` process:
1.  The Hub reads the `id` and `version`.
2.  It signs the build and tags it with this version.
3.  The frontend developer can then pull specific versions using `axiom pull --version 1.4.2`.
