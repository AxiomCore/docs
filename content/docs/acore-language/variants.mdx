Axiom Core allows you to create multiple versions of your API from a single backend. This is useful for excluding "Admin" endpoints from a Mobile app or creating a "Lite" version of your SDK.

### The `include` and `exclude` Logic

By default, every endpoint is included. You can use glob patterns (`*`) to filter routes.

```pkl
variants {
  ["mobile_app"] {
    include = new { "*" }
    exclude = new { "admin_*"; "internal_*" }
  }

  ["partner_api"] {
    include = new { "public_*"; "orders_*" }
  }
}
```

### Per-Variant Policies

You can also apply different default caching strategies per variant:

```pkl
variants {
  ["mobile"] {
    include = new { "*" }
    cache {
      strategy = "network_first"
      ttlSeconds = 60
    }
  }
}
```
