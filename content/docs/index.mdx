# Axiom Core

Axiom Core is a **deterministic behavioral layer** for API consumption. It provides an enforced contract between your backend and client-side applications, ensuring that API behavior—caching, retries, validation, and error handling—is defined once in a signed contract and executed by a high-performance native runtime.

### The Axiom Workflow

Axiom Core sits between your code and the network. It introspects your backend directly, allows you to define behavior in a typed configuration language (**Acore**), and generates a **Thin SDK** that communicates with a native Rust-powered runtime inside your app.

## Current Status

Axiom Core is currently in **Alpha**. We are actively expanding the ecosystem to support more backend frameworks and client platforms.

| Layer | Supported Tech | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Python (FastAPI) | Alpha |
| **Contract** | Acore Language | Alpha |
| **Runtime** | Native Rust Core | Alpha |
| **Frontend** | Flutter (iOS & macOS) | Alpha |

### Coming Soon

*   **Mobile:** Android support for Flutter is imminent and currently in internal testing.
*   **Desktop:** Windows support for Flutter.
*   **Backend Extractors:** Development is ongoing for **Flask**, **Django**, and the **Go (Chi)** framework.
*   **Web:** React/TypeScript SDK powered by WebAssembly (WASM).
