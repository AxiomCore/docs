One of the most powerful features of Axiom Core is its ability to understand your backend structure without requiring a fully configured production environment.

### The Challenge of Traditional Parsing

Historically, extracting a FastAPI schema has relied on two primary methods, each with significant trade-offs:

1.  **Static Analysis:** Tools try to read your code as text. While fast, this is extremely difficult to do correctly given Python’s highly dynamic nature, often missing complex decorators or inherited Pydantic models.
2.  **Runtime Inspection:** Tools actually run your application to see what routes exist. This requires you to have every dependency (Pandas, TensorFlow, SQLAlchemy, etc.) and all environment variables installed just to generate a client or a configuration.

### The Axiom Approach: Ghost Modules

Axiom uses a unique approach called the **Universal Ghost Finder**. When you run `axiom build`, we trigger a specialized Python process that intercepts the native `import` system.

<Callout type="info">
  **How it works:** Our parser creates "Ghost Objects" on the fly. If your code tries to import a heavy library like `torch` or `pandas` that isn't present in the environment, Axiom provides a "Ghost" version of it. This object satisfies the import requirements enough to let the parser reach your FastAPI route definitions and Pydantic models.

#### Benefits of Ghost Introspection:

*   **Zero Dependency Requirements:** You can build your API contract on a machine (or CI/CD runner) that doesn't have your backend libraries installed.
*   **Hybrid Execution:** Because it is a simulated execution rather than simple text parsing, we can accurately resolve complex Pydantic models and FastAPI decorators that static analysis tools would miss.
*   **Efficiency:** By bypassing the loading of heavy third-party libraries, the introspection is significantly faster. While traditional application startup on large codebases can take a minute, Axiom introspection usually completes in a matter of seconds.

### From Python to Acore Memory

Once the structure is extracted, it is converted into a JSON Intermediate Representation (IR) and then mapped into **PKL Memory Objects**. This is the bridge that allows your editor to provide type-safe autocomplete inside your `Acore` files. When you type `Models.` or `Routes.`, you are seeing the direct result of this introspection, mapped into a typed configuration layer.
